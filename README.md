## Thyroid Prediction

The Thyroid Detection and Classification System is a machine learning project designed to diagnose and classify thyroid disorders with precision. This system leverages advanced algorithms to analyze medical data and predict conditions such as Overt Hyperthyroidism, Overt Hypothyroidism, Subclinical Hyperthyroidism, and Subclinical Hypothyroidism.
## Features

- Machine Learning-Based Detection: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for classifying thyroid disorders accurately.

- Web Application Interface: Built using Flask for intuitive data input and result visualization.


## Objectives
- Develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for thyroid disorder detection.
- Implement a web interface for easy data input and real-time predictions.
- Provide healthcare professionals and users with a reliable diagnostic tool.
